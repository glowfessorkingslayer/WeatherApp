# WeatherApp


# Description
This is an Android weather application that uses React Native to utilize and combine stylesheets, flex‚Äêbox, network communication, user input, and images into a simple app. This app calls current weather data by zipcode from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Source code adapted from "Learning React Native" book by Bonnie Eisenman
